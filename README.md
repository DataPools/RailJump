This is a little test project to see if I can get my scratch project running on my phone without requiring Flash.
This uses Adobe PhoneGap for compilation and installation. 
It's currently a WIP and I'd like to get it to work offline. Credits to Nathan Dismore and Mittagskogel for Sulfurous, a javascript compiler for Scratch projects. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Mittagskogel/Sulfurous).

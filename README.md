This is a little test project to see if I can get my scratch project running on my phone without requiring flash.
This uses Adobe Phonegap for compilation and installation. 
It's currently a WIP and I'd like to get it to work offline. Credits to Nathan Dismore and Mittskogel for Sulfurous, a javascript compiler for scratch projects.
